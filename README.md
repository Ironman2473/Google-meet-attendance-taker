# Attendance for Google Meet™

## Description

In the era of COVID-19, virtual classes have become the norm. For teachers, however, taking attendance in these virtual classes is often a pain. They must keep track of when students join and leave among side conversations and distracting visuals. Many teachers at our school complain about the difficulty of taking virtual attendance, claiming that existing Google Chrome extensions are buggy and unreliable.

Our Google Chrome extension, Attendance for Google Meet™, streamlines the entire process of taking attendance in a Google Meet™. All teachers have to do is enter the name of the class and a list of their students. At any time, teachers may click on the attendance button to view each student's status (present, absent, previously present, or not on list), and export the data to a beautifully formatted Google Spreadsheet in their own Google Drive.

## Usage

### Adding a Class
To add a class, click ![Add Class](/img/caps/add-class.png "Add Class") on the Select Class screen. You will be presented with the Edit Class screen, as described below, with a blank title and a blank student list.

### Editing a Class
To edit a class, click ![Edit icon](/img/caps/edit.svg "Edit Icon") next to the class or ![Edit Class](/img/caps/edit-class.png "Edit Class") when viewing the class.

These bring you to the Edit Class screen, in which you can enter the class name and students.

To add students to a class, type their names directly into the text area separated by Comma or Enter.

If you have a spreadsheet with the list of the students in your class, you can copy and paste directly, as shown below. Typing and pasting can be used interchangeably.

Click ![Remove name icon](/img/caps/cancel.svg "Remove Name Icon") to remove a name.

Finally, save your class by clicking the green save button or ![Save Class](/img/caps/save-class.png "Save Class").

### Deleting a Class
To delete a class, click ![Delete icon](/img/caps/delete.svg "Delete Icon") next to the class to bring up a confirmation screen.

### Viewing Class Attendance
The extension displays attendance through a list of entries, as shown below.

![Viewing class attendance](/img/caps/class-view.png "Viewing Class Attendance")

Each entry has a colored symbol on the left representing the student's status.

- Green: Present
- Yellow: Previously Present
- Red: Absent
- Gray: Present, but Not on List

Additional information is provided below each name.

### Adding and Removing Students
Rather than bulk edit a whole class, you can easily add or remove single students from your class by clicking on ![Add student icon](/img/caps/add_circle.svg "Add Student Icon") or ![Remove student icon](/img/caps/remove_circle.svg "Remove Student Icon") next to a student's name. 

![Adding/removing students](/img/gif/adding-removing_students.gif "Adding/Removing Students")

This feature is especially helpful if there is a student present and in your class who is not on your list, in which case you may simply add him or her.

### Sorting Students
To sort the students on an attendance list, click ![Sort icon](/img/caps/sort.svg "Sort Icon") to bring up a list of options.
By default, the extension sorts by Last Name (A-Z).
